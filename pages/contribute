<h3>Bug reports</h3>
<p>The easiest way to contribute is to submit a bug report.</p>

<p>You can do so by using <a href="https://github.com/ltworf/relational/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>If you encounter an error by running a query, please attach the relations that you are using, and the query that generates the error.</p>

<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>Patches are welcome, email them to me: <a href="mailto:tiposchi@tiscali.it">tiposchi@tiscali.it</a>, or open a pull request.</p>

<p>Patches to the backend parser, optimizations, or data structure, should pass all the tests in the testsuite before submission. You can run <code><pre>make mypy && make test</pre></code> to make sure that your patch doesn't break things.</p>

<h3>Things that could use contributors</h3>

<p>Here's a list of ideas for possible contributions.</p>

<p>Remember to get in touch if you start working on something, to avoid duplicating work.</p>

<ul>
<li>A proper icon</li>
<li>A .app bundle for OsX</li>
<li>Possibly easier documentation for newcomers</li>
<li>Support in the parser to memoize operations that might benefit from it. Without doing so for every operation, because that would lead to excessive memory consumption.</li>
<li>Support for parallel execution, with run-time decisions on splitting the tasks among processors.</li>
<li>A website that works on phones</li>
<li>Packages and inclusion in other distributions</li>
</ul>
