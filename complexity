              Complexity

Abstract
   Purpose of this document is to describe in a detailed way the 
   complexity of relational algebra operations. The evaluation will be
   done on the specific implementation of this program, not on theorical
   lower limits.

   Latest implementation can be found at:
   http://galileo.dmi.unict.it/svn/trunk

Notation
   Big O notation will be used. Constant values will be ignored.

   Single letters will be used to indicate relations and letters between
   | will indicate the cardinality (number of tuples) of the relation.
